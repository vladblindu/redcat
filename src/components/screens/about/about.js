                <p className='font-bold text-md text-justify'>Red Cat Studios provides a full range of language services including translation, audio and video
                    localisation, multilingual voiceover. We have succeeded by listening to and working with our clients, who
                    increasingly demand the quality,
                    professionalism and support that only a major business localisation services provider can supply.
                    Furthermore, since we are not an agent - to pass the buck and keep the share,
                    but a first hand service provider, we don't pay the middleman and pass the savings onto our
                    clients!</p>

                <p className='font-bold text-md text-justify'>Our specialists enable our clients to maximise the possibilities available to them to deliver
                    an enhanced service that better reflects the changing needs of our increasingly diversified
                    multicultural environment.
                    We view the long-term relationships with our clients as an indication that we are providing the
                    service and quality they require -
                    and we are grateful that they are telling others about Red Cat Studios, too.
                    We value our client's feedback and do the utmost to reflect this in the products we deliver.</p>
