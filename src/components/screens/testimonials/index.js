                with and extremely helpful throughout the process.
                Even when he faced a slightly difficulty with adding the voice over to the film he solved the situation
                quickly.
                Was a pleasure and I would work with Daniel in the future."</p>

                influence better understanding.
                There is no background noise or mouth sounds made by voice talents and any other factor that could

                that you might like to pass onto the voice over artist as
                well as the rest of the team.</p>
            <p className='font-semibold text-sm lg:text-lg text-justify'>'In my opinion the voice over is good, especially
                as she has to speak so fast! In the source videos they
                speak very fast, and I actually thought that would cause problems for the Swedish voice over, but at
                least in this one it works. Also it's good that the voice sounds young and energetic. No mumblings etc.
                Really it's quite clear considering how fast she speaks.'</p>
            <p className='font-semibold text-sm lg:text-lg text-justify'> I also hope you have a good weekend! Whilst French
                is a definite go-ahead, I should have some further
                news regarding the much larger projects next week."</p>
