                    <p>Although automation is the trend nowadays, we remain faithful to the good old "human" approach
                        and
                        believe there is nothing better than talking to a real person when you need something.
                        Therefore, we strive to respond all your queries in person and within a few working hours (mind
                        those time-zones though, when you are on a different side of the globe than us!).
                        Rates, services, availability, special deals - our Project Managers know them all.
                    </p>
                    <p>And it's only one phone call away: +44 (0)2380 333 360

                    <p>We we'll talk you through our workflow from A to Z, so you can see how we're progressing with
                        your project at every step. Communication with you will go both ways, to make sure all your
                        queries are addressed swiftly and accurately.
                        Your designated Project Manager will remain your point of contact throughout the entire
                        production period. We will explain to you how we're doing things, so you can remain reassured
                        that you are in good company of people who know their business inside and out.
                        Remember, we're not the middleman in this - caring only for the margin share - we are first hand
                        service providers and care about the final output as much as you do!</p>

                        time.</p>
                    <p> If for any reason, we need an extended deadline, we will let you know well in advance, so you
                        can make your own adjustments at your end.
                        Since quality is essential to us, we value your feedback. If, despite our due diligence, you
                        find that our output does not meet your expectations, as expressed in the preparation phase, we
                        commit to fix anything free of charge, within 30 days of delivery.
                        Simply bring to our attention any concerns you may have about the project and let us make it
                        right.</p>
